# Brain-Tumor-NN
A Convolutional Neural Network for classifying Brain MRI imagery according to the presence of a tumor

The Model Architecture used in this project was convnextv2_nano.fcmae, a variant of the convnextv2 architecture known for being a convolutional Neural Network with Transformer like properties.
The selection of convnextv2_nano.fcmae was driven by its data efficiency, superior spatial feature learning, and compatibility with limited computational resources. These characteristics made it ideal for a reliable and scalable brain tumor classification pipeline on a small but crucial dataset.
